IDENTIFICATION OF NEED:

-->Every thing is done manually at present such as customer registration, issuing loans and keeping track of payments.
As the number of customers is high and the risk involved in the transactions due to huge amount involved, the manual system was considered to be inefficient due to huge amount involved, the manual system was considered to be inefficient due to the volume of errors & lesser security.
First when a customer comes to the company he has to be registered and in the manual system it is difficult to verify whether he is already registered.  But in the computerized package it would be very easier to check all the customer details.
When a loan is sanctioned to a customer, calculation of monthly installment is done manually in old system, which may result in wrong monthly installments.  Where as in the automated system, it is exactly calculated according to the number of months and the interest rates applicable.
Also payments from the customers is difficult to maintain which is could be made easier in the computerized package in which simply by entering the loan number all the other information is displayed.
Therefore the problems in the current system have forced the firm to automate it by developing a software package, which would reduce their problems and increase the efficiency.
